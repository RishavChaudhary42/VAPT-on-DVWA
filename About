Reconnaissance:-
To perform this step we setup DVWA → Create/Reset Database → Login → set the DVWA security to low.
This is first step and refers to information gathering about IP addresses and host of thenetwork,open ports and services. we use Nmap , a pre built tool in kali linux. We use
following command to start Nmap and to gather information about application:-
 nmap -sS - sV -T4 <host address of application> and whatweb http://<ip address>/dvwa
Scanning:-
For scanning purpose we use nikto and dirb tools and for HTTP service scanning we use metasploit, a testing frame work.
We use following commands:-
nikto -h http://127.0.0.1/dvwa
dirb http://127.0.0.1/dvwa
SQL Injection:-
SQL Injection (SQLi) is a type of an injection attack that makes it possible toexecute malicious SQL statements. Attackers can go around authentication and authorization of a web page or web application and retrieve the content of the entire
SQL database. They can also use SQL Injection to add, modify, and delete records in the database.
Steps:-
Go to the SQL Injection module.
Enter payload: 1' OR '1'='1 in the ID field.
Click "Submit"
XSS Reflected:-
Reflected XSS is the simplest variety of cross-site scripting. It arises when an application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in
an unsafe way.
Steps:-
Enter payload(<script>alert('XSS')</script>) into input
box.
Click Submit.
Stored XSS:-
Stored XSS arises when an application receives data from an untrusted source and includes that data within its later HTTP responses in an unsafe way. 
Input some unique field in the form field and submit it.
Open page source by pressing CTRL+U and search the unique string in the page source
Use CTRL+F to find the unique string. If the unique string reflects back in the browser screen or in the page source then the site may be vulnerable to stored XSS.
At last, fire the payload of XSS and submit it to get further response in the browser.
If the site is vulnerable, we will get an alert box.
Command Injection:-
Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible
when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell.
Steps:-
Enter payload(127.0.0.1 && ls or 127.0.0.1 && whoami) into IP field.
Click Submit.
HTML Injection:-
HTML injection is a vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to insert arbitrary HTML code into a web page. This happens because the application fails to properly sanitize
user input, allowing hackers to manipulate the way a web page is displayed to users.
Steps:-
Submit comment with HTML content payload is <b>Bold Text</b>
View result.
